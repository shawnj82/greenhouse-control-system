# Intelligent Light Decision-Making System

## Overview

The intelligent light decision-making system answers the question: **"How is the decision on whether to turn a light on going to be made?"** 

This system makes automated, intelligent decisions about greenhouse lighting based on multiple factors, creating an adaptive control system that "comes as close as we can with the data and capabilities at hand."

**🆕 NEW FEATURES:** The system now includes Daily Light Integral (DLI) tracking, configurable time-of-use pricing, and zone-specific morning turn-on times for even more precise control.

## How Decisions Are Made

### 🧠 Decision Engine Architecture

The `LightDecisionEngine` analyzes **8 key factors** for each light:

1. **Plant Requirements** - Crop schedules, growth stages, target light levels
2. **Daily Light Integral (DLI)** - Cumulative daily light exposure tracking 🆕
3. **Energy Efficiency** - Configurable time-of-use pricing optimization 🆕
4. **Ambient Conditions** - Natural light levels, weather conditions
5. **Sensor Feedback** - Current readings, historical performance
6. **Zone Optimization** - Multi-zone coordination, conflict resolution  
7. **Manual Overrides** - User preferences, emergency conditions
8. **Emergency Response** - Safety protocols, failure handling

### 🔍 Decision Process

For each light, the system:

1. **Evaluates Requirements**: Checks plant schedule and target light levels
2. **Analyzes DLI Progress**: Determines if daily light targets are being met 🆕
3. **Considers Energy Context**: Uses configurable time-of-use pricing 🆕
4. **Analyzes Ambient Conditions**: Considers natural light, weather conditions
5. **Calculates Confidence**: Weighs all factors to determine decision certainty
6. **Optimizes Intensity**: Sets appropriate brightness level (0-100%)
7. **Explains Decision**: Provides reasoning for transparency

### 📊 Multi-Factor Analysis

```python
# Example decision factors for a lettuce grow light at 6 PM:
{
    "plant_schedule": 0.8,      # In active growth period
    "dli_progress": 0.6,        # 60% of daily target achieved 🆕
    "energy_cost": 0.3,         # Peak energy rates (configurable) 🆕
    "ambient_light": 0.2,       # Low natural light
    "sensor_feedback": 0.6,     # Adequate sensor data
    "zone_optimization": 0.9,   # No conflicts
    "manual_override": None,    # No user intervention
    "emergency": None           # Normal conditions
}
```

### 🌱 Daily Light Integral (DLI) Integration 🆕

The system now tracks cumulative daily light exposure for each zone:

**DLI Calculation:**
- Converts lux readings to PPFD (μmol/m²/s)
- Accumulates throughout the day (mol/m²/day)
- Compares against plant-specific targets
- Adjusts light intensity to meet but not exceed targets

**Plant-Specific DLI Targets:**
- Lettuce: 14.0 mol/m²/day
- Basil: 16.0 mol/m²/day  
- Tomatoes: 20.0 mol/m²/day
- Herbs: 12.0 mol/m²/day
- Seedlings: 10.0 mol/m²/day
- Flowering: 25.0 mol/m²/day

**DLI Decision Logic:**
- **Early Day**: Higher intensity to meet targets
- **Target Approaching**: Gradual reduction to prevent excess
- **Target Met**: Maintain minimal lighting
- **Target Exceeded**: Turn off to prevent damage

## Real-World Decision Examples
