# Adaptive Light Calibration System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The adaptive light calibration system has been successfully implemented to handle your "seemingly random array of different kinds of lights" and mixed sensor capabilities. The system intelligently adapts to each zone's hardware configuration and provides optimal lighting solutions.

**ðŸ†• Recent Enhancements:**
- **Improved Spectral Fusion Logic:** Sensor data is now fused using energy-preserving rescale, with AS7262 channels mapped using Gaussian curves (FWHM 40nm) and other sensors mapped to wavelength bins with proper normalization.
- **Calibration Factor Validation:** Calibration factors are checked and can be set per sensor, ensuring correct scaling and lux calibration for each device.
- **Histogram Analysis:** Graphical and numerical histograms are generated for each sensor and the combined fusion, aiding in calibration and debugging.

## Key Features Implemented

## How It Handles Your Requirements

### "Seemingly Random Array of Different Kinds of Lights"
âœ… **Solution**: The system automatically detects each light's capabilities (color control, power, spectrum) and adapts optimization strategies accordingly.

### "Some Will Support Color, Others Only Intensity"
âœ… **Solution**: Mixed capability optimizer chooses appropriate strategies:
- Full spectrum optimization for color-capable zones
- Intensity-only optimization for basic zones
- Graceful degradation when capabilities are limited

### "Some Areas Will Have Multiple Light Color Options Some Will Not"
âœ… **Solution**: Zone-specific optimization that:
- Uses advanced algorithms for zones with multiple color options
- Falls back to simpler strategies for zones with limited options
- Provides feedback on what's possible in each zone

### "When a Zone is Asking for a Certain Color and Intensity We'll Just Come as Close as We Can"
âœ… **Solution**: Best-effort optimization with:
- Confidence scoring for each optimization result
- Detailed feedback on limitations and suggestions
- Fallback targets when exact requirements can't be met

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Adaptive Calibration
```python
# Web API
POST /api/calibration/adaptive
# Uses zones.json configuration automatically

# Python
calibrator = LightCalibrator(data_dir='data')
results = calibrator.optimize_zones_with_adaptive_strategy({})
```

### 2. Crop-Based Optimization
```python
crop_types = {
    "A1": "lettuce",
    "A2": "basil", 
    "B1": "tomatoes"
}
growth_stages = {
    "A1": "vegetative",
    "A2": "flowering",
    "B1": "seedling"
}

results = calibrator.optimize_for_mixed_zone_types(crop_types, growth_stages)
```

### 3. Custom Zone Requests
```python
zone_requests = {
    "A1": {
        "target_par": 200,
        "target_color_temp": 4200,
        "target_spectrum": {"blue_percent": 30, "red_percent": 35, "green_percent": 35},
        "intensity_priority": 1.0,
        "color_priority": 0.8
    }
}

results = calibrator.optimize_zones_with_adaptive_strategy(zone_requests)
```

### 4. Zone Capability Analysis
```python
# Check what each zone can do
report = calibrator.get_zone_capability_report()

# Web API
GET /api/calibration/capabilities
```
